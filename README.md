# Matrix Bot

Matrix Bot is a C programming language project designed to perform complex matrix calculations. It includes functionalities such as calculating idempotent matrices, identity matrices, matrix inverse, involutory matrices, transposition, and more. This project is aimed at simplifying advanced matrix operations through an efficient and user-friendly implementation.

## Features

- **Idempotent Matrix**: Identify and verify if a matrix is idempotent (A^2 = A).
- **Identity Matrix**: Generate and validate identity matrices.
- **Matrix Inverse**: Calculate the inverse of a matrix (if it exists).
- **Involutory Matrix**: Determine if a matrix is involutory (A^2 = I).
- **Transpose**: Compute the transpose of a given matrix.
- **General Matrix Operations**: Additional matrix-related functionalities for advanced computations.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the project, ensure you have the following:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).
- A terminal or IDE that supports C development.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notavishek/Matrix_bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Matrix_bot
   ```

3. Compile the project using your preferred C compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o matrix_bot matrix_bot.c
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./matrix_bot
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your matrix and perform desired operations.

### Example

- Input a 3x3 matrix to calculate its transpose:
  ```text
  Enter the number of rows: 3
  Enter the number of columns: 3
  Enter matrix elements:
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9

  Transpose of the matrix:
  1 4 7
  2 5 8
  3 6 9
  ```
